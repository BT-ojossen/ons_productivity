Open Net Productivity : Packaging module
----------------------------------------

The 'productivity' modules is a complete family of modules offering improvement for OpenERP.
These modules are maintained by Open Net, Swiss Partner of OpenERP.
These modules are included in all our hosting solutions.

**Features list :**
    - a new field: the price of a package
    - the sell price becomes a weighted average value, example:
        - if package = 50 units and the customer wants 52 units, 
        - then the unit price will be: (50*(unit price for 50) + 2*(unit price for 1))/52
